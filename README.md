# MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol

> In the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol, a broker is a central server that receives published messages from client devices (publishers) and routes them to the interested parties (subscribers). The broker acts as a mediator between publishers and subscribers, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery of messages.

The main function of the broker is to manage the flow of messages between devices, by storing messages and forwarding them to subscribers based on their subscriptions. The broker also maintains information about the connected clients and their current state (e.g. connected, disconnected).

The use of a broker in MQTT provides several benefits, including scalability, security, and reliability, as well as enabling communication between devices that are not directly connected to each other.
