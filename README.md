# MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol

> In the MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) protocol, a broker is a central server that receives published messages from client devices (publishers) and routes them to the interested parties (subscribers). The broker acts as a mediator between publishers and subscribers, ensuring reliable and efficient delivery of messages.

The main function of the broker is to manage the flow of messages between devices, by storing messages and forwarding them to subscribers based on their subscriptions. The broker also maintains information about the connected clients and their current state (e.g. connected, disconnected).

The use of a broker in MQTT provides several benefits, including scalability, security, and reliability, as well as enabling communication between devices that are not directly connected to each other.

## MQTT Protocol with STM32 

> MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, publish-subscribe messaging protocol designed for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. It is widely used in IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M (Machine to Machine) communication.

In MQTT, a client device can either publish messages to a broker or subscribe to receive messages from the broker. The broker acts as a central hub that routes messages between clients based on their topic subscriptions.

STM32 is a 32-bit microcontroller platform used in a wide range of applications, including IoT devices. MQTT can be used with STM32 to enable communication between the microcontroller and other devices in an IoT network. For example, an STM32 microcontroller can publish sensor data to a broker, and other devices can subscribe to receive and act on that data.

Using MQTT with STM32 can provide several benefits, such as efficient and reliable communication, low overhead, and compatibility with a wide range of other devices and platforms. To use MQTT with STM32, you will need to integrate an MQTT client library into your STM32 project and configure it to communicate with an MQTT broker.
